By drawing for example the odd rows of one modality and even rows of the other, i.e., without shared index for sensors position, we again ensure that the possible enhancement is due to the multi-modality itself and not because of major change in sensors position.
Otherwise, if for example we select odd rows from both mono-modalities, the sensors layout in mono-modality would be significantly different from multi-modal layout.
Because we are assuming that each MEG sensor is selected among the whole standard sensors, based on the proximity to an EEG sensor, to minimise the distance between each pair of EEG and MEG sensors.
So, if the index set of selected sensors in one mono-modality does not have any shared sensor's index with the other mono-modality, the difference in sensors position in mono-modality and multi-modality will be minimised.
