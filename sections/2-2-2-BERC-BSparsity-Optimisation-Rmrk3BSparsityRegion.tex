\begin{remark}[Block-sparsity regions in figure \ref{fig:MixedNorm-Map}]
As shown in figure \ref{fig:MixedNorm-Map} the proposed block-sparsity region (orange region) covers the existing most frequently studied cases in block sparsity problem (green circles) and the widely used tractable case in the traditional sparsity problem (the right blue circle) in literature.
