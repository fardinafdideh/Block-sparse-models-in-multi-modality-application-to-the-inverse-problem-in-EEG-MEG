\caption{Forward problem is solved when the head (scalp, skull, and brain layers), source ($K$ source positions), and sensor ($m$ sensors) models are given.
The lead-field matrix $\myPhi$ of dimension $m$ by $3K$ is resulted from concatenation of $K$ three-column matrices corresponding to $K$ source positions in source space.
%Then with the resulted leadfield matrix, the inverse problem can be solved, i.e., given a measurement on sensors, the corresponding active dipole(s) can be estimated.
