Firstly, we need to redefine the structure of the dictionary and the representation vector and consequently the model.
Then, an appropriate optimisation problem yielding block-sparse solutions should be investigated.
Finally, suitable block-wise characterisations of the dictionary, which would be the base material for proposing the solution's uniqueness will be required.
All the above mentioned requirements for establishing Block-ERC are investigated in this section through the following parts of \emph{structure and model}, \emph{optimisation problem}, and \emph{characterisations}.
