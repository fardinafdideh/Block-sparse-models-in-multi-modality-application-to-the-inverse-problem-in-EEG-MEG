\begin{remark}[Sparsity regions in figure \ref{fig:MixedNorm-Map}]
For $0 \sless p_1 \seq p_2 \seq p \sleq 1$, the block-sparse exact signal recovery optimisation problems $P_{p,p}$ and $P_{\boldsymbol{w};p,p}$ reduce to the traditional exact signal recovery problem, i.e., $P_{p,p} {\equiv} P_p$ and $P_{\boldsymbol{w};p,p} {\equiv} d^{-1/p} \, P_p$ ($\forall k, d_k \seq d$).
In other words, in the common region of sparsity and block-sparsity, i.e., $p_1 \seq p_2 \seq 1$ (the right blue circle in figure \ref{fig:MixedNorm-Map}), and under certain conditions, the conventional exact signal recovery problem can recover the block-sparse representation.
In addition, for $p_1 \seq 0$ and $p_2 \seq 1$ (the left blue circle in figure \ref{fig:MixedNorm-Map}), the $P_{0,1}$ problem reduces to the classic exact signal recovery problem, i.e., $P_{0,1} {\equiv} P_0$, but it is still non-convex.
