From algorithmic point of view, Ganesh and his colleagues proved that supposing a $k$-subspace sparse measurement vector $\boldsymbol{y}$, if $k \sless \mySpk_S(\myPhi) / 2$ then the sparse decomposition is necessarily unique in their proposed algorithms of subspace matching pursuit and subspace base pursuit \cite{Ganesh2009}.
