\begin{remark}
It should be noticed that, $\Vert \boldsymbol{a} \Vert _p$ for $0 \sless p \sless 1$ does not satisfy the required triangle inequality property of a norm function.
Therefore $\Vert \boldsymbol{a} \Vert _p$ for $0 \sless p \sless 1$ is commonly referred to as a $\ell_p$ pseudo-norm instead of $\ell_p$ norm.
