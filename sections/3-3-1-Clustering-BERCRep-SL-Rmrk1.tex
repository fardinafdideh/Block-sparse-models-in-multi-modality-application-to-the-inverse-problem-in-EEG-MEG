\begin{remark}
%Remember that for $q \seq p$, the block-sparsity level in the most pessimistic and optimistic cases are equal, i.e., $\myBSL^{pes}(\myPhi) {\equiv} \myBSL^{opt}(\myPhi)$, whereas 
For $d_1 \seq \cdots \seq d_K$, the upper-bound and lower-bound of the range of sparsity level are equal, i.e., $\mySL_{max}(\myPhi) {\equiv} \mySL_{min}(\myPhi)$.
