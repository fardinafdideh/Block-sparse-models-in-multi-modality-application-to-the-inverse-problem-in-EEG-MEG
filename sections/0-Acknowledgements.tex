I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisors, Prof. Christian JUTTEN and Ronald PHLYPO, for their continuous support of my Ph.D research, who their door of office was always open whenever I had a question about my research, in addition to their guidances in our regular meetings, which steered me in the right research direction.

This work would have been impossible without the financial support of Prof. Christian JUTTEN as the principal investigator of the granted fund of the European Research Council (ERC) for the research project of the Challenges in the Extraction and Separation of Sources (CHESS).

I am also grateful to each of the jury members, Prof. Maureen CLERC, Charles SOUSSEN, David BRIE, and Sa\"{i}d MOUSSAOUI, for their very valuable comments on this thesis. Especially, I would like to thank Prof. Charles SOUSSEN who his invaluable and numerous comments 
%during the last five months 
had a significant impact on the quality of the thesis.

Moreover, many thanks go out to my post-doc supervisors in Lyon Neuroscience Research Center (CRNL), Mathilde BONNEFOND, Olivier BERTRAND, and Jérémie MATTOUT, for their patience and support I received during the extended 
%six 
months before the Ph.D defense. 

It is also worth mentioning that my migration to France in order to undertake and start this Ph.D, which has been a truly life-changing experience for me, would definitely not have been feasible without the full support of Prof. Mohammad Bagher SHAMSOLLAHI (my Master's supervisor in Sharif University of Technology) and Christian JUTTEN, which makes me profoundly and life-lastingly grateful to them.

At last, my deep appreciation goes out to my family members, my parents, Aliakbar and Fahimeh, and my siblings, Farnaz and Pedram, for always believing in me and encouraging me to follow my dreams. And to my spiritual teachers especially Lida, for enormously
helping me to first have the courage to embark on this journey, then confronting the consequent challenges, and finally to complete what I started.
