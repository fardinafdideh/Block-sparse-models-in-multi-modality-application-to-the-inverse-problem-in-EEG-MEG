Fusion coherence in the context of fusion frames is defined as $M_F(\myPhi) \seq \max_{i \neq j} \{ |\left\langle \boldsymbol{\varphi}_i , \boldsymbol{\varphi}_{j} \right\rangle | \cdot ||\boldsymbol{P}_i \boldsymbol{P}_j||_{2 {\to} 2}\}$, where, $\boldsymbol{P}_i$ denotes the orthogonal projection onto the fusion frame subspace $W_i$ \cite{Boufounos2011,Ayaz2014,Ayaz2016}.

Fusion coherence in the special setting, where the projection matrices are equal to one or all the subspaces have dimension one, reduces to MCC, i.e., $M_F(\myPhi) {\equiv} M(\myPhi)$ \cite{Boufounos2011}, whereas for the equally-sized subspaces, reduces to the block-coherence defined by Eldar et al., i.e., $M_F(\myPhi) {\equiv} M^{Eldar}_{Inter}(\myPhi)$ \cite{Boufounos2011}.
