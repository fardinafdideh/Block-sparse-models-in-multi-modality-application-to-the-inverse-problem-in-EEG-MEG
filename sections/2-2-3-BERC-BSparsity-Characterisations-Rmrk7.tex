\begin{remark}
\label{cmmnt:26} 
By comparing the bounds of conventional MCC, i.e., $1/\sqrt{m} \sleq M(\myPhi) \sleq 1$ (equation (\ref{eq:M-bounds}), page \pageref{eq:M-bounds}), with the upper-bounds of the proposed dictionary coherence in table \ref{table:BMIC-orth-bound-min}, where, there is intra-block orthonormality and considering $d_{min} \seq d_{max} \seq m$ (orthonormal complete bases), it can be seen that, \myhl{although the obtained upper-bound for Block-MCC$_{1,\infty}$ is greater than that of conventional MCC ($m$ v.s. $1$), but both characterisations have the same upper-bound for ($q,p$) pairs of ($1,1$), ($1,2$), ($2,\infty$), and ($\infty,\infty$), while the upper-bound for ($2,2$) is $1/m$, which is much less than the conventional unit upper-bound, and even less than the lower-bound of conventional MCC ($1/m$ v.s. $1/\sqrt{m}$).}
%all the upper bounds are significantly less than to the upper-bound in (\ref{eq:M-bounds}).
