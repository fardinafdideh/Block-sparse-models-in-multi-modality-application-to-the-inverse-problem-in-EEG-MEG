\begin{remark}
\label{rmrk:BSpark-intractable} 
Although the Block-ERC based on $\myBSpkTxt$ in Theorem \ref{th:BERC-BS} (Block-ERC based on $\myBSpkTxt$) improves the conventional condition of Gorodnitsky and Rao \cite{Gorodnitsky1997}, Donoho et al. \cite{Donoho1989,Donoho2001,Donoho2003,Donoho2003a}, Elad and Bruckstein \cite{Elad2001,Elad2002a}, Gribonval and Nielsen \cite{Gribonval2003a,Gribonval2003}, and Bruckstein et al. \cite{Bruckstein2009}, when it comes to practical computations both conditions would become unrealistic, because both the characterisation $\myBSpkTxt$ (and corresponding $\mySpkTxt$) and the related optimisation problem $P_{p,0}$ (and corresponding $P_{0}$) are non-convex.

Therefore, the next step would focus on at least the related optimisation problems which are tractable.
In the next section we propose conditions for more general optimisation problems of $P_{\boldsymbol{w};p_1,p_2}$ and $P_{p_1,p_2}$, where, $0 \sleq p_2 \sleq 1 \sleq p_1$.
