\begin{remark}
\label{rmrk:BNSP-intractable} 
Although the proposed Block-NSP (Theorem \ref{th:BNSP}) is a generalisation of all the previous null space properties, in general the characterisation $Q_{\boldsymbol{w};p_1,p_2}(S_b\myparanthese{\mybeta},\myPhi)$ is not easy to calculate.
Therefore, in the next section the tractable characterisation of coherence will be taken into consider.
