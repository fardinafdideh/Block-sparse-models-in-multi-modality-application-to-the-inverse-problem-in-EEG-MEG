As an extension of the studies of Eldar et al., Ziaei and his colleagues study the same problem with different block sizes \cite{Ziaei2010}. 
For establishing their findings, they introduced a new version of the block-coherence of Eldar et al., i.e., $M^{Eldar}_{Inter}(\myPhi)$ defined in (\ref{eq:Eldar-Block-coherence}), replacing $d$ by $\max_{i , j {\neq} i} \sqrt{d_i d_j}$, where, $d_i$ is the length of block $i$ 
%$\sqrt{d_{max}d_{max \sm 1}}$, where $d_{max}$ and $d_{max \sm 1}$ are the lengths of the last two blocks of $\myPhi$ 
\cite{Ziaei2010}.
