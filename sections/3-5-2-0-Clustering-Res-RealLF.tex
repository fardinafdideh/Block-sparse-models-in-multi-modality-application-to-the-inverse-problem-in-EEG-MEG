In this experiment the hierarchical clustering is used because of its characteristic in estimation of the number of clusters, as described in section \ref{sec:hierarchical_cluster_estim}.
In order to simulate or import real-world sensor, source and volume conduction head model required to generate the real lead-field we used an open source software package MATLAB-based toolbox named FieldTrip \cite{Oostenveld2011}.

EEG lead-field is obtained using 32 standard electrodes and utilising three different volume conduction head models of three-layer concentric spheres, realistic three-layer with inflated cortical sheet obtained by boundary element
methods and realistic three-layer with highly-folded cortical sheet obtained by SPM8 software \cite{SPM}.
Realistic head models are obtained by imposing anatomical constraint, which is provided by MRI\footnote{\emph{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}}.

Similarly, for MEG lead-field generating, 32 standard sensors closest to the previously selected 32 EEG standard electrodes are selected and single sphere, realistic single layer with inflated and highly-folded cortical sheets are used as volume conduction head models.
The sensor model, three-compartment (brain, skull, and scalp) volume conduction head model (analytical and realistic), and source model (spherical and realistic) are shown in figure \ref{fig:Sensor_vol_Source}.
