%    First challenge is about the ineffectiveness of some classic methods in high-dimensional problems.
%Second challenge raises when classic recovery conditions cannot be established for a new concept of constraint of corresponding optimisation problem, because of materials shortage in new framework. 
%Finally, the combination of different information of a same phenomenon is the subject of the third challenge.

%    In the first part of thesis, we present general theoretical recovery conditions ensuring the uniqueness of the solution of underdetermined systems of linear equations.
    
%Then, in the second part by utilizing the idea of clustering the coherent parts of the dictionary based on the proposed characterisation, we demonstrate the improvement of the proposed recovery conditions and also by applying the idea on the real-world EEG or MEG leadfiels and without using any information about the brain sources activity and EEG or MEG signals we introduce brain regions and segments which with their activation still the unique recovery is ensured.

%Finally, in the last part of thesis we show that by combining the EEG and MEG leadfields and gaining the electromagnetic properties of the head, more refined and precise brain regions are appeared, hence, EEG and MEG multi-modality advantage will be proved from another point of view.

%In this study, we propose four theoretical (algorithmic-independent) and one algorithmic-dependent Block-sparse Exact Recovery Conditions (BERCs), which guarantee the uniqueness of block-sparse recovery in general dictionaries through a general mixed norm minimisation problem. 
%These conditions are derived using the proposed Block-sparse Uncertainty Principles (BUPs) and Block Null Space Property (BNSP), based on some newly defined characterisations of \emph{block spark}, \emph{$(q,p)$-Block Mutual Incoherence Constant (BMIC$_{q,p}$)}, \emph{$(q,p)$-Cumulative Block Mutual Incoherence Constant (CBMIC$_{q,p}$)}, and \emph{Cumulative Inter-block Incoherence Constant (CIIC)}.
%Some of the proposed characterisations and also the corresponding optimisation problems for theoretical conditions are convex and some are non-convex. 
%Recently, it has been turned out that exploiting the block structure of the representation gives rise to improvement in the conventional recovery condition, however we redemonstrate this benefit.
%We show that there is improvement in the conventional recovery condition when exploiting the block structure of the representation. 
%In addition, the proposed BERCs extend the existing results for block-sparse setting by generalising the criterion for determining the active blocks, weakening the block-sparse recovery conditions, and relaxing some constraints on blocks such as linear independency of the columns.
