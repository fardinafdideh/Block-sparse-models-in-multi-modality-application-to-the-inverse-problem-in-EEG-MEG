In addition, in the context of fusion frame theory, Boufounos et al. have proved that if $k \sless (1 \spl M_F^{-1}(\myPhi))/2$, then the unique recovery of his $ \ell_0$ and $ \ell_1$ norm optimisation problems is guaranteed \cite{Boufounos2011}.

Later, Ayaz et al. improves some of the results of Boufounos et al. in the fusion frame setup \cite{Ayaz2014,Ayaz2016}.

The recovery condition based on the fusion coherence in the special setting, where, all the subspaces share the same dimension, reduces to (\ref{BERC-Eldar}) \cite{Boufounos2011}.
