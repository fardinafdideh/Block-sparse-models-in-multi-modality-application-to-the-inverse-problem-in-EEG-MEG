In addition, the fusion NSP defined in the fusion frame framework proposed by Boufounos et al., in a special case in which all the subspaces share the same dimension, becomes similar to the NSP proposed by Stojnic et al. \cite{Boufounos2011}.

Moreover, the notions of exact, stable and robust NSP for fusion frames are presented in \cite{Ayaz2014,Ayaz2016}.
