\begin{remark}
\label{Rmrk:DontKnow2}
Table \ref{table:MaxMToBeBetterMCC} demonstrates that our proposed sparsity level for the $\ell_{2 {\to} 2}$ operator-norm, which is equal to the conventional $\ell_{2}$ matrix norm, requires the most strict upper-bound on $M(\myPhi)$ in order to be higher than the conventional sparsity level, while the dictionaries with characterisations that use operator-norms other than $\ell_{2 {\to} 2}$ can be less incoherent (more coherent, i.e., higher $M(\myPhi)$ is allowed), and especially for $\ell_{1 {\to} \infty}$ operator-norm the most relaxed upper-bound on $M(\myPhi)$ is achieved.
This is one of the advantages of utilising operator-norms, which enable us to have more relaxed conditions by exploiting norms other than the conventional $\ell_{2}$.
