In order to compare the resulted brain source space segmentation in a specific clustering level to the conventional lobes of the brain, the closest boundaries to the conventional boundaries are shown in figure \ref{fig:Atlas}(a) and (b).

The brain segmentation and boundaries resulted from EEG, and MEG lead-fields are shown in figure \ref{fig:Atlas}(a), and (b), respectively.
The anatomical lobes and the functional areas of the brain are shown in figure \ref{fig:Atlas}(c).

Therefore, using the proposed framework, i.e., clustering coherent blocks of the lead-field with the help of the proposed Block-MCC$_{q,p}$ coherence measure, the conventional structural and functional brain lobes can be divided into subject-specific refined regions.
