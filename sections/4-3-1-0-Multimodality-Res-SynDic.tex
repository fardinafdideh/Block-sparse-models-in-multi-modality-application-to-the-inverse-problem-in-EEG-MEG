In this part, the set of two complementary random dictionaries $\myPhi_i \ssin \mathbb{R}^{10 \stimes 80}$, $i \seq \{\boldsymbol{1} , \boldsymbol{2} \}$, with equally-sized blocks of length $d_j \seq d \seq 2$, $\forall j$, is generated from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables and all columns of the dictionaries are normalized to have unit $\ell_2$ norm.

%In this chapter, the experiments of multi-modality have done on synthetic dictionaries and real EEG/MEG leadfields.
%In the experiment with synthetic data, 
In order to generate two complementary random dictionaries, 
%and to ultimately combine them, 
firstly, as described in Section \ref{sec:Artificial simulated dictionary}, one of the dictionaries is generated by setting the related parameters $\varepsilon_{inter}$ and $\varepsilon_{intra}$.
Then, utilising the same strategy and by setting the parameter $\varepsilon_{inter-dictionary}$, which controls the overlap between the two dictionaries, the second dictionary is produced.
In figure \ref{fig:Multomodal-Phi}(a) and (b), the role of different types of $\varepsilon$ in generation of random dictionaries $\myPhi_{\boldsymbol{1}}$ and $\myPhi_{\boldsymbol{2}}$ is shown.
Then, as shown in figure \ref{fig:Multomodal-Phi}(c) by drawing half of the rows of each of the dictionaries and finally by making a sufficient shift on one of the set of rows belonging to one dictionary, here $\myPhi_{\boldsymbol{2}}$, the combined dictionary $\myPhi_{\boldsymbol{12}}$ is obtained.
All the results are shown in average and standard deviation over 100 repetitions of generation of complementary random dictionaries pairs.
