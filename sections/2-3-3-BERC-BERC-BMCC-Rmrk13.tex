Therefore, exploiting the block structure information of the representation and using the proposed characterisation of the dictionary, named Block-MCC$_{q,p}$ (Definition \ref{def:BMIC}, page \pageref{def:BMIC}), improves the conventional MCC-based ERC of Donoho et al. \cite{Donoho2001,Donoho2003,Donoho2006a}, Gribonval and Nielsen \cite{Gribonval2003,Gribonval2007}, Tropp \cite{Tropp2004}, and Bruckstein et al. \cite{Bruckstein2009} by increasing the sparsity level, hence weakening the corresponding conditions.
The mentioned improvement is under condition on conventional MCC, which ensures that the dictionary is sufficiently incoherent, i.e., MCC is small enough.
