\caption{From initial block $\boldsymbol{\mu}^0$, $N$ representative blocks of clusters are computed. Then, from each representative block $\boldsymbol{\mu}^i$, all blocks $\myPhi^i\mybracket{j}$ belonging to the same cluster $i$ are generated.}
%Assuming $N$ clusters and $K$ blocks, $\boldsymbol{\mu}^i$ is the representative block of cluster $i$, and $\myPhi^i\mybracket{j}$ is the block $j$ belonging to cluster $i$ resulted from multiplication of a n $\varepsilon$-based matrix 
%, where based on the value of $\varepsilon$, resulted matrices can have certain amount of overlap with the one originated from.}
