In classical assumption, the recovery conditions are generated from the columns of coefficient matrix, but clustered coefficient matrix consists of some differently-sized blocks, and not necessarily columns.
Therefore, the initial assumption of classical recovery conditions does no longer hold true. 
How can appropriate recovery conditions be developed for block-structured problems?
