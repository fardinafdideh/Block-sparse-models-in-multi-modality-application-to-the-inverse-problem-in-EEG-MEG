In this section, the multi-modality strategy will be experimented on synthetic dictionaries and real EEG/MEG lead-fields.
In all of the experiments, the agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis based on the block structure identification framework proposed in Chapter \ref{sec:Clustering} will be applied on the dictionaries.

The proposed inter-block coherence measure in a special case, Block-MCC$_{2,2}$\footnote{\emph{$({2,2})$-Block Mutual Coherence Constant}}, is used to compute the similarity matrix in the hierarchical clustering algorithm, i.e., $M_{2,2}(\myPhi) \seq \max_{k,k' \neq k} \Vert \myPhi^\dagger[k] \myPhi [k'] \Vert_{2 {\to} 2} /d_{max} $.
%The $M_{1,\infty}(\myPhi)$ is selected, because the fraction $\Vert \boldsymbol{x} \Vert_{\boldsymbol{w};p,1} / \Vert \boldsymbol{x} \Vert_{\boldsymbol{w};q,1}$ in Corollary \ref{crl:BERC-BMIC} is maximized for $q \seq 1$ and $p \seq \infty$.

%M_{1,\infty}\myparanthese{\myPhi}

\subsection{Real EEG and MEG lead-field}
In this part, the original lead-fields, which build the multi-modal lead-field are the ones explained in Section \ref{sec:Real EEG/MEG leadfield}.
Therefore, there are three head models with spherical, realistic inflated, and realistic highly-folded cortical sheets as shown in figure \ref{fig:Sensor_vol_Source_EMEG}.

The 32 sensors shown in figure \ref{fig:Sensor_vol_Source_EMEG} are in multi-modal case, where, there are equal number of sensors from both modalities.
By selecting the odd and even rows of EEG and MEG USLE, respectively, we can see that the sensor distribution is almost uniform, i.e., the sensors are not concentrated in a region of brain.

\paragraph{EEG and MEG complementarity in brain source segmentation}
In Section \ref{sec:EMEG_Complementarities}, some basic complementarities of EEG and MEG were discussed.
In this section we show that in the brain source segmentation using the proposed strategy of clustering coherent lead-fields corresponding to brain sources utilising Block-MCC$_{q,p}$, we can observe some complementarities between brain source segmentation employing EEG or MEG lead-field.

In figure \ref{fig:EMEG_complementarities}, the brain clusters or regions based on clustering of the EEG or MEG lead-field for clustering levels 3, 10, 15, 17, and 20 and three types of cortical sheets are shown.

It can be seen that for the all shown clustering levels, the previously mentioned complementarity also appears in our brain source segmentation strategy, which is more visible in low clustering levels in figure \ref{fig:EMEG_complementarities}.
%For instance in figure \ref{fig:EMEG_complementarities}(a), for the brain source segmentation using EEG leadfield at the third clustering level, the occipito-parietal (left and right hemisphere in different segments) and frontal lobes are appeared whereas using MEG leadfield results in temporal brain lobes (see figure \ref{fig:Sensor_vol_Source_EMEG} for the orientation of head), which are complementary.
%In higher clustering levels, e.g., for 17 clusters, other than revealing some complementary precise regions, generally utilizing the EEG leadfield results in the segmentation of the left and right hemisphere while the MEG leadfield results in segmenting the central part as shown in figure \ref{fig:EMEG_complementarities}.

\paragraph{EEG and MEG multi-modality and the clustering tree}
\label{EEG and MEG multimodality and the clustering tree} 
The agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, using the standard inter-cluster distance and our proposed inter-block similarity methods builds a hierarchy of clustering structures, which is represented in the clustering tree, as shown in figure \ref{fig:EMEG_Multimodality_Dendrogram}.

The clustering trees built using EEG, MEG, and multi-modal EEG+MEG lead-fields for spherical, realistic inflated, and realistic highly-folded cortical sheets are shown in figure \ref{fig:EMEG_Multimodality_Dendrogram}(a), (b), and (c), respectively. 

As mentioned before, the advantage of using the hierarchical clustering algorithm is in estimating the number of clusters and in general the block structure, by selecting a block structure corresponding to the longest inter-node distance.
Also, one can impose other constraints such as minimum number of clusters.

In figure \ref{fig:EMEG_Multimodality_Dendrogram}, for each source model, the block structure is opted based on a minimum number of clusters and maximum inter-node distance.
To make clusters distinguishable, each cluster is colour-coded.

\label{EEG and MEG multimodality and the number of regions}
%\subsubsection{EEG and MEG multimodality and the number of regions}
%In figure \ref{fig:EMEG_SL}, the maximum sparsity level in the most optimistic case is shown for the leadfields of EEG, MEG, and their combination computed for six tractable similarity measures BMIC and four algorithms calculating inter-clusters distance, named 'Average', 'Complete', 'Weighted', and 'Ward'.
%The leadfields are obtained using spherical volume conduction head model.
%As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:EMEG_SL}, in most cases the sparsity level resulted from the combination of EEG and MEG leadfields is higher than that of EEG or MEG leadfield alone.

In order to estimate the number of clusters from the dendrogram as described in Section \ref{sec:hierarchical_cluster_estim}, in addition to the constraint of the maximum distance between consecutive nodes or clusters in dendrogram, the number of clusters is also set to be greater than a threshold.

As it can be seen in figure \ref{fig:EMEG_Multimodality}(a), the estimated number of clusters or brain regions resulted from the EEG and MEG multi-modal lead-field for spherical cortical sheet is 10, which is more than the estimated number of brain regions using EEG or MEG lead-field alone, which both are 8 clusters. %, respectively.
The similar results are obtained for realistic head models as shown in figure \ref{fig:EMEG_Multimodality}(b) and (c).

Therefore, brain source space segmentation using the proposed strategy of clustering the coherent lead-fields based on the introduced Block-MCC$_{2,2}$ is more refined when utilising EEG and MEG multi-modal lead-field compared to EEG or MEG mono-modal lead-fields.
%by utilizing EEG and MEG multi-modal leadfield the brain segmentation will be more refined.
%In addition the maximum sparsity levels are higher than those in unimodal dataset, which means that multi-modality can improve the block-sparse exact recovery conditions through increasing the sparsity levels.

\paragraph{EEG and MEG multi-modality and the area of regions}
In this part, for a fixed number of regions or clusters, the area of brain regions is investigated for EEG/MEG mono-modal lead-fields and multi-modal EEG and MEG lead-field clustering.

In this experiment, to better demonstrate the impact of multi-modality on the area of brain regions, only the source model with spherical cortical sheet is used.
In addition the standard \emph{average} method is used to compute the inter-cluster distance.
In this method, the distance between two clusters is defined as the average distance between each point in one cluster to every point in the other cluster.
Furthermore, the Block-MCC$_{1,\infty}$ is used as coherence measure.

In the top row of figure \ref{fig:EMEG_regionsArea}, it can be seen that in each certain number of clusters, the biggest area (maximum value in bar chart) belongs to multi-modal EEG and MEG lead-field clustering and nearly for all the other regions the area for multi-modal EEG and MEG is less than EEG or MEG lead-field alone. 

In addition, the area of brain regions are represented in pie charts.
The largest area is coloured as blue in pie charts, which is not very obvious in brain source space in the current angle of view.
Because, the region with maximum area represents brain sources at the bottom of the head, where, there is not any sensor on it, whereas the other regions represent brain sources under the sensors.
%For multi-modal EEG and MEG leadfield clustering, these values are lower than EEG or MEG

Therefore, for a fixed number of clusters, brain regions under sensors in multi-modal lead-field clustering are smaller than mono-modal lead-field clustering.
Hence, EEG and MEG multi-modality leads to increased brain source space resolution.
%the other advantage of multi-modality is increase in brain source space resolution.
