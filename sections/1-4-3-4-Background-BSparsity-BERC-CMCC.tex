The mutual subspace coherence of Ganesh et al. \cite{Ganesh2009} represents only the most extreme correlation between the subspaces of the dictionary and does not offer a comprehensive description of the dictionary. 

In order to extract more information and to better characterise the dictionary, Elhamifar and Vidal focused on the cumulative version of mutual subspace coherence.

In the block-wise world, Elhamifar and Vidal proved that if the measurement vector $\boldsymbol{y}$ has a unique block $k$-sparse representation vector $\mybetaz$, and the subspaces spanned by the columns of the blocks are disjoint, then under 
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{\frac{1+\sigma_p}{1+\epsilon_p}}M_S\myparanthese{\myPhi , k} + M_S\myparanthese{\myPhi , k-1} < \frac{1-\epsilon_p}{1+\epsilon_p},
\end{equation*}
the optimisation problems $P_{p,1}$ and $P_{p,0}$ are equivalent, and also under
\begin{equation*}
M_S\myparanthese{\myPhi , k} + M_S\myparanthese{\myPhi , k-1} < \frac{1-\epsilon'_p}{1+\epsilon'_p},
\end{equation*}
the optimisation problems $P_{(p,1),q,0}(\mybeta_{\myPhi},\boldsymbol{r})$ and $P_{(p,0),q,0}(\mybeta_{\myPhi},\boldsymbol{r})$ are equivalent, where, $\sigma_p$, $\epsilon_p$, and $\epsilon'_p$ are some intra-block $p$-restricted isometry constants which are defined based on the restricted isometry properties introduced in the paper \cite{Elhamifar2012b}.
