\caption{(a) MEG measures vectorial magnetic field, whereas EEG measures scalar potential differences, (b) MEG sensors are located outside the head, whereas EEG sensors are placed on the surface of the head, (c) MEG is mostly sensitive to primary currents, whereas EEG is sensitive to secondary currents, (d) MEG has very low sensitivity to radial dipoles, (e) MEG has low sensitivity to deep sources, (f) EEG is highly sensitive to the geometry and conductivity of media, and (g) EEG and MEG topographies for a same source activity are almost orthogonal to each other.
%Nature and requirements of EEG and MEG recordings are different, (b) MEG is sensitive to primary currents, whereas EEG is sensitive to secondary currents, (c) MEG is blind to radial and deep sources, (d) EEG is highly sensitive to the geometry and conductivity of tissues, and (e) EEG and MEG topographies are almost orthogonal
